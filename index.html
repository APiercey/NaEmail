    <h1>NaEmail Demo</h1>

    <p>Hello! This is a simple demo for NaEmail. What with the name? 'Na' means 'after' in Dutch. When I built this, I was soon leaving to visit The Netherlands and needed a name, so it was just inspirational. It short for it's original name "After Loading Email".</p>

    <p>Here are some working examples:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <span class="na-email" 
                  data-email-name="alexander.piercey" 
                  data-email-domain="gmail" 
                  data-email-top-level="com">
                This will dissapear after load and be replaced with an email :)
            </span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="na-email" 
                  data-email-name="hello" 
                  data-email-domain="world" 
                  data-email-top-level="foo.bar">
                Here's another with multi-level top domain!
            </span>
        </li>
        <li>
            Here is an example inside some content! Gasp! My email is <span class="na-email" data-email-name="example" data-email-domain="somesite" data-email-top-level="de">SHHH! It's a secret ;)</span>. No spam please :p.
        </li>
        <li>
            With working email mailto: <a href="#" class="na-email" data-email-name="example" data-email-domain="somesite" data-email-top-level="de">Beautiful!</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            But what if I don't want to replace the inner content but just make it a link? <a href="#" class="na-email" data-email-name="sayyou" data-email-domain="love" data-email-top-level="me" data-email-dont-replace>By golly! That works too! Fiestaaa!</a>
        </li>
    </ul>
