# NaEmail
A simple javascript script to "replace" email markup with a real email. Fight spam!

## Why
I built this for a friend who was concerned about getting spam in their e-mail. So, I decided to make a script for fun to help them :)

Now, I release it into the wild!

## What's with the name?
'Na' means 'after' in Dutch. When I built this, I was soon leaving to visit The Netherlands and needed a name, so it was just inspirational.
